        <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
        <p>
            The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California. The band consists a
            dynamic
            lineup
            featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists, a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved
            its first
            commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention from their future manager. Having extensive
            experience working
            with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the band could succeed even further with more
            support,
            pushing The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record label.
        </p>
        <p>
            From there, the band has soared, gaining international recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the
            Poster Charts. New
            fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic attitude, solidifying their place as
            one of the
            hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The
            Hive” and are
            drawn to their candid and authentic performances on stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording their
            second studio
            album, looking to be released in early 2024.
